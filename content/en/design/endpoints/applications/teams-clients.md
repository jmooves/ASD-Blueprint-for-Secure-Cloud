---

The [Microsoft Teams client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/teams-client-desktop-admin) operates across multiple platforms and devices, necessitating distinct security and management approaches. Configuration spans both local client settings and integrations with Entra ID, Intune, Defender for Office 365, and Purview.

These approaches are shaped by the two primary contexts in which Teams clients are used:

- **[User clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/teams-client-desktop-admin):** This includes desktop clients (Windows, macOS, VDI), mobile clients (iOS, Android), and web clients. These are used by individual users signing in interactively. This context supports security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), as well as Intune compliance and data protection policies.

- **[Device clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/devices/certified-devices-overview):** This includes Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTRs) and panels, and Teams Phones. These are typically communal, appliance-like devices that sign in automatically using non-interactive resource accounts. As such, they do not support MFA. Instead, they rely on Intune device compliance policies and other foundational [security measures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/rooms/security) to reduce the attack surface.

### User client configuration

Teams client configurations are managed through a combination of Entra ID, Intune, and the [Teams admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/manage-teams-in-modern-portal). Together, these platforms control access, enforce compliance, and govern in-app functionality:

- Entra ID evaluates [Conditional Access policies](/configuration/entra-id/protection/conditional-access/policies) to enforce user authentication and session prerequisites.
- Intune secures endpoints by applying device compliance rules and application data protection policies.
- The Teams admin center manages in-app functionality through service-side, user-centric policies for meetings, messaging, and calling.

### User client deployment

User clients are managed differently depending on their platform. The Teams desktop client is typically [deployed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/deploy-overview) as part of the Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise suite but follows its own [update lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/teams-client-update). Mobile clients are distributed via public app stores or managed through Intune.

| Decision point                  | Design decision                                                          | Justification                                                                                |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop deployment method       | Include the Teams client in the base Microsoft 365 Apps deployment       | Simplifies the initial rollout and ensures all users receive Teams by default                |
| Desktop client update mechanism | Use the Teams client's native auto-update engine                         | Reduces administrative overhead and ensures the client remains current with security updates |
| Mobile client deployment        | Use Intune to manage the deployment of Teams on corporate mobile devices | Ensures clients are properly installed and managed, and enables compliance checks            |

### Device security and management

Shared Teams devices should be managed separately from user clients because they use non-interactive resource accounts, which do not support user-based security controls like multi-factor authentication (MFA).

A layered security model is required to manage sign-in, compliance, platform hardening, and updates. Intune enforces device-level configuration and compliance, while the Teams admin centre manages application settings and certified firmware updates.

| Physical security                | Where possible, use lockable enclosures, port blockers, and tamper-evident seals                                                                                                                                                  | Prevents theft, physical tampering, and unauthorised peripheral access                             |

### Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)

Running [Teams in VDI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/teams-client-vdi-requirements-deploy) introduces unique requirements not present on physical clients:

- The VDI platform should support media optimisation to offload AV processing from the session host to the user's local endpoint, which is required to prevent high latency and server load.
- The client should be installed per-machine on the golden image. For the [VDI 2.0 architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/vdi-2), this is a _slim client_ that requires periodic image updates, even though its PWA components auto-update.
- A solution like [FSLogix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/fslogix/overview) is required for non-persistent sessions to roam user-specific data and prevent Teams from re-installing or re-syncing at every sign-in.
- The user's local device (thin client or PC) should be certified for optimisation and have a direct network path to Microsoft 365 media relays, bypassing the VDI connection.

### End-to-end encryption (E2EE)

Teams supports E2EE for [one-to-one calls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/teams-end-to-end-encryption) and, with Teams Premium, for [scheduled meetings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/end-to-end-encrypted-meetings) of up to 200 participants. E2EE ensures only the communicating endpoints can decrypt content, providing maximum confidentiality.

E2EE disables features such as recording, transcription, live captions, call transfer, and compliance auditing. It can be used in scenarios where confidentiality requirements take precedence over collaboration features and oversight capabilities.

### Network optimisation

A high-quality Teams experience requires an [optimised network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/prepare-network) that provides a direct path to the Microsoft 365 service endpoints and prioritises real-time media traffic. Bandwidth needs can be estimated using the [Network Planner tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/network-planner), and ongoing network health is monitored using the Teams [Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/monitor-call-quality-qos).

This network prioritisation can be implemented using [Quality of Service (QoS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/qos-in-teams) by applying Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) markings to packets and [configuring clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoftteams/qos-in-teams-clients) and network infrastructure to respect those markings.

### Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO) integration

Teams is integrated with [Defender for Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-office-365/mdo-support-teams-about) which provides both Teams-specific features and broader security services that enable specific features within the Teams client.

### Purview integration

The Teams client enforces data governance policies configured in Purview. This integration is essential for protecting information in real time. Organisations should consider implementing [Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/purview/dlp-microsoft-teams) using Sensitive Information Types (SITs) to automatically detect and block sensitive and security-classified information from being shared in chats and channels.

Additionally, [Purview sensitivity labels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/purview/sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites) can be applied to Teams meetings to enforce security controls and, with Teams Premium, these controls can include advanced protections such as applying watermarks to shared content or video feeds and blocking meeting recording.

Using Purview for Teams containers, chats, and channels is discussed in more detail in the [labelling and classification](/design/shared-services/purview/labelling-and-classification) design page.
