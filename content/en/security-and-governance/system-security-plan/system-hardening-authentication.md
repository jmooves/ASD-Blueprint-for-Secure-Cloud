description: This page provides a template and guidance to assist organisations in documenting their approach to authentication hardening associated with their system(s) built on ASD's Blueprint for Secure Cloud.

{{% alert title="Instruction" color="dark" %}}

The authentication hardening section of a System Security Plan (SSP) should document an organisation's approach to hardening user authentication. As with other sections of the SSP, information in the server application hardening section should be documented according to the relevant controls outlined in ASD's ISM and the SSP Annex.

All template text refers to a typical implementation of a system built using the Blueprint, and includes reference to organisational policies, processes and technical configurations to be implemented in addition to the technical controls that may be configured using guidance in the Blueprint. Any implementation implied by the below should not be considered as prescriptive as to how organisations must scope, build, document, or assess a system.

When completing the below template, organisations should insert and update information where relevant to ensure it accurately represents their approach to operating system hardening. When complete, remove any instructional boxes throughout.

Due to the number of applicable controls in ASD's [_Guidelines for System Hardening_](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism/cyber-security-guidelines/guidelines-system-hardening), guidance on system hardening has been split into its five sections for the purpose of this SSP.

### Authentication hardening

#### Applicability

This section of the SSP is applicable to the hardening of authentication methods within the system boundary of `<SYSTEM-NAME>`.

`<INSERT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS APPROPRIATE>`

#### Organisational policies and processes implemented

`<SYSTEM-NAME>` provides a central identity store that governs and grants all user access prior to accessing `<SYSTEM-NAME>` resources. Users are assigned specific user roles according to their business requirements.

Credentials for Break Glass Accounts, local administrator accounts and service accounts are required to be a minimum of 30 characters, uniquely and unpredictably generated, and managed in accordance with the `<SYSTEM-NAME>` [System Administration Process and Procedures](/security-and-governance/policies), including ensuring that all service accounts are created as Managed Service Accounts.

`<INSERT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS APPROPRIATE>`

#### Technical controls implemented

Technical controls for authentication hardening within `<SYSTEM-NAME>`'s are configured with reference to ASD's [_Blueprint for Secure Cloud_](https://blueprint.asd.gov.au) and includes the following technical configurations.

Microsoft Entra ID is configured as the central store for identity and access management within `<SYSTEM-NAME>`, acting as central management for user authentication and authorisation to various Single Sign On (SSO), including as for access to `<SYSTEM-NAME>` Windows endpoints. Notably, Entra ID implements SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, and WS-Federation for authentication and authorisation to Microsoft applications and services, with legacy authentication methods disabled.

Due to default [Microsoft Entra password policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/entra/identity/authentication/concept-sspr-policy?tabs=ms-powershell#microsoft-entra-password-policies), control ISM-2079 _Password complexity requirements are not imposed for passwords_ cannot be achieved for system(s) built using the Blueprint.

Technical controls are implemented according to the relevant ISM control topics listed below:
